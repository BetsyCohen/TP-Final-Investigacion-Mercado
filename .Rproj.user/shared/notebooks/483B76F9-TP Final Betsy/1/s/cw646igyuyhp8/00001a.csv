"1"," ""Hi! My name is Luciano. I was born and raised in Patagonia, came to study in this unique city many years ago. I’ve also lived abroad (Amsterdam) and traveled a bunch —which is never enough—: needless to say…I love to walk the earth.  \nI have many passions: sports —running, hiking, tennis, biking and, of course, soccer—; languages, art, music, literature and cinema. I have friends from different countries and I enjoy hosting and showing them around, as I do with our guests whenever I have the chance.  My family and I offer several apartments in the best parts of town. We have been renting them for about 18 years! We were one of the first ones in BA to join Airbnb back in 2010. It has been an amazing experience to be part of this community, and we have had the chance to welcome visitors from all over the globe.\n\nLet me know if I can help you with your plans in la Reina del Plata, you are going to love Buenos Aires..."""
